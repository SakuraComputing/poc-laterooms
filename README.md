# LateRoom Exercise

Technologies used:

React 16
Redux
Jest
Enzyme

The application filters on a simple text box as well as the checkboxes and re-orders based on star rating. I have used redux and basically dispatched an action to add the inital data load when the application starts.  It also filters using redux.

The application is very simple one and I have tried to demonstrate what I could do quickly but well within the desired time.  I have tried to lay the project out in an intuitive way so that other developers could find things quickly.  

## Quickstart

```
git clone 
yarn install
```

Testing has been carried out using Jest and Enzyme. If have taken a TDD approach for this task, write the test first allow this to go red commit then write the component ensure the test then goes green. The command below will run the tests
```
yarn test
```

## Further work 
Greater test coverage is required.
