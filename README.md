# LateRoom Exercise

Technologies used:

React 16
Redux
Jest
Enzyme

The application is very simple one and I have tried to demonstrate what I could do quickly but well within the desired time.  I have tried to lay the project out in an intuitive way so that other developers could find things quickly.

## Quickstart

```
git clone 
yarn install
```

Testing has been carried out using Jest and Enzyme. If have taken a TDD approach for this task, write the test first allow this to go red commit then write the component. The command below will run the tests
```
yarn test
```

## Further work 
Create a reducer to handle the filtering / ordering and use a selector to return the correct results.
Use a code coverage tool
Look at using Cucumber or something similar for acceptance testing
